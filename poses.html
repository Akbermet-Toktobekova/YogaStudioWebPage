            <p>
                00:12
Hi everyone, welcome to Yoga With Adriene. I'm Adriene, here's Benji. We're gonna jump right in with this five minute full body stretch. Take a deep breath in. And wherever you are, as you exhale, relax the shoulders, meaning wherever you are mentally, however you're feeling physically, take another deep breath in.

<br>00:37
And exhale again, relax your shoulders. Feel them dropping away down from the ears. And one more time, deep breath in. And this time, draw the shoulder blades together. Imagine them melting down the back as you lift the chest. Beautiful. We're gonna come to all fours for Cat-Cow. So nice and slow. See if you can keep up that nice, slow, deep

<br>01:06
Breathing as we consciously stretch the body here. Inhale, drop the belly, open the chest. Oh my gosh, Benji's so cute. Exhale, round through the spine. Move slow here, really feeling the front body and the back body. Stretch it out as you breathe. Inhaling, the belly drops and the crown of the head extends. And then exhale, round the spine.

<br>01:35
Chin comes to the chest and the navel really draws up towards the spine. One more time really exaggerating this movement, feeling the stretch.

<br>01:51
Nice, and then widen the knees as wide as your yoga mat. Send the hips back, stretch the fingertips forward. So really active arms here. Then lift the center of your palms, so just your fingerprints are pressing into the mat. Wrists are reaching up towards the ceiling. And then we'll slowly begin to melt the chest and the shoulders, maybe the head down. And you feel this traction in the arms.

<br>02:19
in the shoulders and the upper back. Now breathe, feel the expansion as you inhale through all four sides of the torso. So expanding through all four sides, good. And then exhale, hug the lower ribs in and feel that stretch deepen.

<br>02:39
Lovely. Slowly come back up to all fours, Tabletop Position.

<br>02:46
On your next inhale, reach the right arm forward, the left foot, the left leg back. Now imagine someone's pulling your right wrist and pulling your left ankle. So we're really focusing on the stretch today. Hug those low ribs up and in, slight bend in your left elbow so it's not locked. Then drop your left hip in line with your right hip as you breathe in. Good, exhale, round everything. Think Cat here.

<br>03:17
Good, inhale, extension, stretch it out. And exhale, rounding the spine, feeling that low back stretch as you hug the lower ribs in. Good, one more, inhale, reach, spread the fingers, spread the toes, and exhale, round through. Good, release and switch. Left fingertips forward, right toes back, stretch it out, deep breath from Benji.

<br>03:44
Nice, exhale, round it through. So again, we're focusing on the stretch today. So stabilize with your foundation and then really focus on reaching, reaching, reaching as you extend out. And then as you hug it in, focus on bringing the low ribs up towards the spine. So you really feel that stretch in the back. You'll feel your abs turn on too. Bonus, inhale, reach it forward. Exhale, bring it in.

<br>04:13
Good, walk both hands out now. Curl the toes under, take a deep breath in. Keep the knees bent as you peel the tailbone up towards the sky and then slowly drop the heels down towards the earth. Bend your right knee as you anchor the left heel. Feel the stretch in the back of that left leg. And then switch, right heel comes down, bend the left knee, stretch in the right leg. Now both knees bend.

<br>04:42
Think about bringing your hip points higher up towards the ceiling as you stretch, stretch, stretch. Heart melts towards the knees here. And then both heels down. Breathe in. And slowly breathe out. Bring the knees back to the earth and come into a seat. Good, we're gonna end with a Forward Fold. So send your legs out in front. Inhale, reach for the sky.

<br>05:07
Exhale, feel free to bend the knees or you can keep them straight here as you come into Pashitottanasana. Can always work to build that length in the hamstring, rounding forward, take a deep breath in. Stretching the calves as you flex the toes up towards your head. Feeling that stretch in the back of the knee, the hamstring. And if you're really tight in the low back, go ahead and bend those knees for one more breath and feel that.

<br>05:38
Love in the lower back as you breathe in.

<br>05:43
To release, on an exhale, slowly roll up. We'll bring one ankle in and then the other.

<br>05:54
space. Inhale, bring the thumbs up to the third eye. And we continue to stretch throughout our day. Keeping an open mind and open heart. And I hope you feel good in your body. Thank you for being here today. Inhale in. Exhale to bow. Namaste.
